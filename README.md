Material Design is a DroidScript plugin for building Material 3 Themed Applications.

> **TLDR:** This plugin is no longer maintained.

## What's the road forward ?

I will like to thank everyone who was involved in the development of this plugin - The DroidScript Community over at Discord.

The road forward is to adopt alternatives, I will recommend these : 

1. [F7Wrapper by JohnPrise](https://ds.justplayer.de/projects/f7wrapper)
2. [Enjin UI plugin by D.S Team](https://enjine-io.github.io/ui/docs/ui-v0.31/ui.html)
